# Project 1

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
---
The College Board (SAT), in partnership with ACT Inc. wishes to explore if:
<ul> 
  <li>Household median annual income</li>
  <li>College enrollment rates </li>
  <li>State population </li>
  <li>Test participation rates </li>
  </ul>
have any relationship with each state's ACT and SAT performance. 
<br>
<br>
We are a team of analysts hired to analyse the provided data, use supporting data from other sources  and present our findings to the college boards.
<br>
<br>

---
## My task
---
* To find out if each state's SAT / ACT participation rates had a relationship with SAT / ACT performance respectively.
* Optional: To find trends within intended college major, test takers and test score
* Optional: To find out if household median annual income had a relationship with SAT / ACT performance. 
<br>
<br>

## Construct function for data munging
---
* Write a function that takes in a string that is a number and a percent symbol (ex. '50%', '30.5%', etc.) and converts this to a float that is the decimal approximation of the percent. For example, inputting '50%' in your function should return 0.5, '30.5%' should return 0.305, etc.

## Method of analysis
---
<br>

### 1. Incorporate Bryan's cleaned data with my SAT_processed data
* Formated values in columns in Bryan's data to have consistency with my data
* Added new 'National' row for SAT data to match with ACT 'State' column keys
* pd.merged SAT and ACT data
* Changed column names for clarity and differentiation between ACT and SAT data
* Export to [SAT_ACT_combined.csv](data/processed/SAT_ACT_combined.csv) without new index
* Removed 'National' row prior to analysis but leave it in exported dataset
<br>

### 2. Incorporate Anand's cleaned data (median income) with SAT_ACT_combined data
* Renamed 'United States' row to 'National'
* Added 'Income_mean' column
* Removed 'National' row after merge
* Export to [SAT_ACT_income_no_national](data/processed/SAT_ACT_income_no_national.csv) without new index
<br>
<br>

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis 
---
<br>

#### Summary Statistics
---
* `df.describe()`
* `df.isnull().sum()`
<br>
<br>

---
#### Dictionary comprehension to find standard deviation
---
* Self-constructed standard deviation function `std_dvn(col)`
* Assign variable to dictionary
* `{col.name:std_dvn(col) for col in [df[i] for i in df.columns if (df[i].dtype=='float64') or (df[i].dtype=='int64')]}`
<br>

## Summary of findings
---
<br>

---
### SAT scores association with participation rates
---
* Negative correlation between SAT participation rates and SAT scores
* Using hypothesis testing
  * Mean SAT participation rates have a consistent statistically significant relationship with predicting SAT performance scores
    * 3 out of 4 datapoints showed SAT participation rates have a statistically significant relationship in predicting SAT EBRW, Math, and Total scores respectively. 
* States that perform well in one component in SAT, tend to also perform well in other components in SAT
* 75th percentile SAT participation rate increasing from 2017 to 2019
<br>
<br>

---
### ACT scores association with participation rates
---
* Negative correlation between ACT participation rates and ACT scores
* Using hypothesis testing
  * Mean ACT participation rates have a consistent statistically significant relationship with predicting ACT performance scores 
    * 3 out of 4 datapoints showed ACT participation rates have a statistically significant relationship in predicting ACT English and Reading scores respectively 
* Candidates tend to perform better in reading component compared to english component for ACT (consistent for 2017-2019)
* 25th percentile ACT participation rate decreasing from 2017 to 2019
<br>
<br>

---
### SAT vs ACT
---
* Negative correlation between SAT and ACT participation rates
* Positive correlation between ACT scores and SAT participation rate
* Positive correlation between SAT math/total scores and ACT participation rate
<br>
<br>

---
### SAT/ ACT performance association with income
---
* ACT math performance has a weak positive correlation to median income
* Household median income generally follow normal distribution
* Household median Income shows a statistically significant relationship with ACT scores but not with SAT scores
<br>
<br>

---
### College acceptance rates association with ACT/SAT percentile scores
---
* Negative correlation between ACT/SAT percentile scores and university acceptance rates
* Health profession is the most popular major shortlisted by SAT candidates in 2019. However, candidates who shortlisted this major were not best performers
<br>
<br>

---
## Recommendations to college boards
---
* More data is required from other years e.g 2011 to 2021 for a better certainty on trends and association
* More research is recommended to find out what barriers candidates from low income households in US face to performing well in ACT
* More research is recommended to find out why states that perform well in SAT and ACT tend to have lower participation rates
* More research is required to find out why household median income does not seem to affect SAT performance as much as it affects ACT performance, and how to replicate that effect for ACT.
